# Practice
Here I will place some projects that contain some of my practices, I like to practice my skills by doing things. 

## Practice LINQ
To practice some LINQ queries I've created a project with JSON data. In the Practice test project you're able to write some queries yourself. I'll add some test methods which will fail, but if you write the right query they will pass. Good luck! 
*This is still really small, maybe I'll create an app for such things later.*
